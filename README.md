# Guitar Steero

This project is made to fit the niche of someone who wants to practice racing pedal inputs without the hassle of fully firing up their sim of choice.

## Current Functionality

Currently this app is only being tested with my personal badass G25 setup.  If it doesn't work on your side, feel free to open an issue and I'll see what I can do.

Right now the app can take input from two pedals and visualise it on a graph.
There is also text 'telemetry' data included from steering wheel inputs.

## Future

I'd like to pre load the telemetry data with 'scenarios' or 'corners' that you can practice going through
Scenarios in mind:
    Heavy braking (different shapes for different cars)
    Heavy braking with trail brake (again, above^)
    Light braking 
    Light braking with trail brake

Extra Credit
    Wheel input
    Visual companion
